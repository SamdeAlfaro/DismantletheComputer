                Dismantle the Computer: An Intervention into Computer Science Education
            </h1>
            <p>
                I’m a senior at Gallatin studying computer science and queer and feminist theory. I am particularly interested in the production of science and its consequences in technological development. In the past few years, I’ve become interested in computer science education, on both the K-12 levels and on the higher education level. I have been working as a teacher of computer science for high school students over the summers, and have been studying educational practices during my time at Gallatin. <br>
                <br>
                The central aim of my project is to understand how we can reframe computer science education to contextualize practice within social and political frameworks. This project primarily focuses on studying pedagogical practices through K-12 education, and I am developing a model for accessible and inclusive computer science education platforms. <br>
                <br>
                Through my concentration at Gallatin, I have studied histories of computer science, particularly in the area of education. Drawing from these texts and personal experience, I have noticed several gaps in computer science education. In particular, educational theorists promote several assumptions about who is pursuing science, and why. For instance, education in programming languages often assumes an understanding of hardware that is necessary for a low-level comprehension of how languages work. This instance points to a much greater issue in computer science education: the separation of technical information from its broader context. If one is taught how a computer works, without ever understanding what (and who) makes the computer work, then how can we expect computer scientists to be aware of the implications of their actions? If a computer scientist can barely understand the physical or social mechanisms that make their profession possible, then there is a serious gap in computer science education. My project aims to address these gaps. <br>
                <br>
                There are three dominant traditions in computer science education; thinking of computing as engineering, as math, or as science. These traditions reflect intellectual shifts in conceptualizing computing. When we consider computer science a facet of engineering, we aim to teach programming. The central goal is teaching students to create things that work. Computer science as math instead places more emphasis on concepts and logic. The aim is to explain to students how to make things work efficiently. Science, instead, applies other implications to computing. If we assume science to be neutral and objective, then it is implied that computer science would too exist outside of culture and time. <br>
                <br>
                Another model of computer science education exists by drawing from art education. This approach focuses on exploration, method, and materiality. This may help refocus computer science towards syntax and beauty. An emphasis on clarity and conciseness could even help mitigate the issues of technical debt, created by outdated systems too complexly intertwined and reliant on each other to easily untangle. <br>
                <br>
                The application of a material-centered education as seen in the arts and certain laboratory sciences could prove particularly beneficial. This would contextualise computer science in the physical, and frame computing knowledge through a larger network of media. Teaching computer science as grounded in materiality would equally facilitate the understanding of relationships between companies and industries, as many of them are tied through channels of production. Furthermore, this could encourage students to consider environmentally aware practices when computing. <br>
                <br>
                While I’ve sketched several gaps in computer science education, my actual project aims to tackle just the issue of materiality. I am in the process of creating a website that serves as part artwork and part educational platform. I 3D modelled a computer, and have documented all of the components as artworks. The model is representative of an interactive way to teach computer science, focusing on contextualising computers within their material part. Users can manipulate the model and explore. <br>
                <br>
                While this art model has multiple benefits in computer science education, it is not a silver bullet. In fact, a key tension that arises is in the question of ownership and individuality. Art is typically created to be observed, appreciated, and critiqued, but the intention is rarely for it to be used or copied without permission. This contrasts sharply with the collaborative and shared nature of coding, where the goal is often to encourage reuse and adaptation. Coding has always been an additive, mosaic process; with Stack Overflow, Github, and now AI chatbots, the coding process requires the coder to first look for what has already been done, then to take and adapt it into their work. Similar to collaging, the coder must learn to select, understand, and reconfigure pieces of code to create something new. This is also a central facet of open-source philosophy. <br>
                <br>
                In practice, coding systems are often owned by corporations, and individuals work to contribute to a pool of knowledge with limited access. If we teach code as art, are we implicitly suggesting that students own the code they create? Yet a lack of ownership in code isn’t an end-all be-all answer either; while it serves to work collaboratively and build upon others’ ideas, a lack of ownership equally diverts responsibility for mistakes. <br>
                <br>
                Computer science education cannot solely rely on traditional modes of instruction; it must adapt to incorporate a multifaceted approach that encompasses project-based learning, group work, considerations of authorship, and fostering a culture of collaboration. By drawing from open source ideologies, the art education model, and various computer science models, we must consider new and interdisciplinary ways to teach computer science. <br>
                <br>
                In response to this, I propose what I call the ‘artefact model’, which encourages students to think about computing objects within their context. This pedagogy aims to keep students away from thinking of computing as some magical abstraction; students must perceive computing objects within their contextual reality rather than as abstract entities. It is far too easy to spend a life staring at a screen, and never question where our creations, stored on the cloud, truly exist on the ground. Artefact thinking proposes breaking down computational objects, such as theories, concepts, and practices, and examining them not unlike art history examines artworks. Students are required to consider these objects within their historical context: how they have come to be, and what are their implications. Furthermore, artefact thinking requires establishing computer science as a human artefact and human creation, thus centering it within human activity. <br>
                <br>
                The artefact model offers a pathway to cultivate a new practice in computer science education—one that prepares students to create code that is not only technically proficient but also cognizant of its historical, social, and ethical dimensions. In combining aspects of art, science, math, and engineering education, we may develop a new practice that can prepare students to create effective, powerful, and beautiful code.
