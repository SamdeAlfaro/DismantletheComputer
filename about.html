                Dismantle the Computer: An Intervention into Computer Science Education
            </h1>
            <p>
                I’m a senior at Gallatin studying computer science and queer and feminist theory. I am particularly interested in the production of science and its consequences in technological development. In the past few years, I’ve become interested in computer science education, on both the K-12 levels and on the higher education level. I have been working as a teacher of computer science for high school students over the summers, and have been studying educational practices during my time at Gallatin. <br>
                <br>
                The central aim of my project is to understand how we can reframe computer science education to contextualize practice within social and political frameworks. This project primarily focuses on studying pedagogical practices through K-12 education, and I am developing a model for accessible and inclusive computer science education platforms. <br>
                <br>
                When we think about computer science, what often comes to mind is the introduction to college-level courses, which teach the basics of coding. Yet computer science also has a presence in K-12 education, in which the goal is often to familiarise students with computers and logical literacy. At this stage, computer science doesn’t only focus on coding, but more generally on what can be done with computers. Students may learn some basics of programming, but also online safety, or how to recognize reliable websites. This K-12 curriculum rarely focuses on explaining the computer from a hardware perspective. Yet this later becomes assumed knowledge in college-level courses and is therefore equally pushed aside. <br>
                <br>
                Through my concentration at Gallatin, I have studied histories of computer science, particularly in the area of education. Drawing from these texts and personal experience, I have noticed several gaps in computer science education. In particular, educational theorists promote several assumptions about who is pursuing science, and why. For instance, education in programming languages often assumes an understanding of hardware that is necessary for a low-level comprehension of how languages work. This instance points to a much greater issue in computer science education: the separation of technical information from its broader context. If one is taught how a computer works, without ever understanding what (and who) makes the computer work, then how can we expect computer scientists to be aware of the implications of their actions? If a computer scientist can barely understand the physical or social mechanisms that make their profession possible, then there is a serious gap in computer science education. My project aims to address these gaps. <br>
                <br>
                There are three dominant traditions in computer science education; thinking of computing as engineering, as math, or as science. These traditions reflect intellectual shifts in conceptualizing computing. When we consider computer science a facet of engineering, we aim to teach programming. The central goal is teaching students to create things that work. Computer science as math instead places more emphasis on concepts and logic. The aim is to explain to students how to make things work efficiently. Science, instead, applies other implications to computing. If we assume science to be neutral and objective, then it is implied that computer science would too exist outside of culture and time. <br>
                <br>
                Another model of computer science education exists by drawing from art education. This approach focuses on exploration, method, and materiality. This may help refocus computer science towards syntax and beauty. An emphasis on clarity and conciseness could even help mitigate the issues of technical debt, created by outdated systems too complexly intertwined and reliant on each other to easily untangle. <br>
                <br>
                The application of a material-centered education as seen in the arts and certain laboratory sciences could prove particularly beneficial. This would contextualise computer science in the physical, and frame computing knowledge through a larger network of media. Teaching computer science as grounded in materiality would equally facilitate the understanding of relationships between companies and industries, as many of them are tied through channels of production. Furthermore, this could encourage students to consider environmentally aware practices when computing. <br>
                <br>
                While I’ve sketched several gaps in computer science education, my actual project aims to tackle just the issue of materiality. I am in the process of creating a website that serves as part artwork and part educational platform. I 3D modeled a computer, and have documented all of the components as artworks. The model is representative of an interactive way to teach computer science, focusing on contextualizing computers within their material parts. Users can manipulate the model and explore it without needing direct access to a computer to dismantle. In a classroom setting, this could look like asking students to explore the components of the computer to understand how different parts communicate with one another. <br>
                <br>
                While this art model has multiple benefits in computer science education, it is not a silver bullet. In fact, none of these models individually addresses the three key tensions in computer science education. The first tension that arises is in the representation of open-source ideology. Open-source software makes possible most of our internet technologies and involves an entire set of social norms that are rarely discussed in college classrooms, and never seen in K-12 education. Science education addresses this, as scientific ideals ask for the free-distribution of scientific knowledge. Art education may also be able to address this through a focus on collaboration. Yet art education doesn’t necessarily also address issues of ownership and individuality. <br>
                <br>
                Art in K-12 education is typically created to be observed, appreciated, brought home at the end of the day; the intention is rarely for it to be used or copied without permission, nor for students to copy others’ work. This contrasts with the collaborative and shared nature of coding, where the goal is often to encourage reuse and adaptation, facilitated by tools such as Stack Overflow, Github, and now AI chatbots. In fact, it is nearly impossible to code a project without importing libraries and other people’s work. When we fail to educate students on open-source philosophy, properly documenting code sources, and maintaining knowledge of hardware, students are not prepared to write good code. On a very basic level, this could mean students are less aware of how to create code that efficiently uses the computer’s hardware. But this can also lead to greater issues such as a lack of attribution to other coders, difficulties working collaboratively, and disregarding ethical considerations when coding. <br>
                <br>
                Computer science education cannot solely rely on traditional modes of instruction; it must adapt to incorporate a multifaceted approach that encompasses project-based learning, group work, considerations of authorship, and fostering a culture of collaboration. By drawing from open source ideologies, the art education model, and various computer science models, we must consider new and interdisciplinary ways to teach computer science. <br>
                <br>
                In response to this and drawing from art history education, I propose what I call the ‘artefact model’, which encourages students to think about computing objects within their context. This pedagogy aims to keep students away from thinking of computing as some magical abstraction; students must perceive computing objects within their contextual reality rather than as abstract entities. It is far too easy to spend a life staring at a screen, and never question where our creations, stored on the cloud, truly exist on the ground. Artefact thinking proposes breaking down computational objects, such as theories, concepts, and practices, and examining them not unlike art history examines artworks. Students are required to consider these objects within their historical context: how they have come to be, and what are their implications. Furthermore, artefact thinking requires establishing computer science as a human artefact and human creation, thus centering it within human activity. <br>
                <br>
                The artefact model offers a pathway to cultivate a new practice in computer science education—one that prepares students to create code that is not only technically proficient but also cognizant of its historical, social, and ethical dimensions. In combining aspects of art, science, math, and engineering education, we may develop a new practice that can prepare students to create effective, powerful, and beautiful code.
